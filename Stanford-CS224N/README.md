# Stanford CS 224N | Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Solutions to assignments from [Stanford CS 224N][1], specifically from Winter 2020. As of 2020-12-06, the website does not seem to have access to the videos for Winter 2020, though it has all the slides, notes and assignments and has similar course plan as [Stanford CS 224N Winter 2019][2] which has all the [course videos in YouTube][3]. The solutions are my attempts after going over these lectures online and are not canonical or graded solutions. Also please be aware of [Stanford Honor Code][4].
